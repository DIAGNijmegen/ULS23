## Baseline Model
`/GC_algorithm` will contain the code to build a GrandChallenge algorithm out of our baseline model.

`/nnunetv2` contains the extensions to the nnUnetv2 framework that should be merged with your local install.

`train_test_split.json` contains the train/test split used for evaluation of the baseline model, use it if you want to reproduce our results.
